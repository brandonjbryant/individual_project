# This repository is designated to hold my individual project

#Project Goals
- This project is intended to help  classify the quality of red wine using various features. I will try to use various classification models to find best accuracy score.

## Data Dictionary 

#### Target
Name | Description | Type
:---: | :---: | :---:
quality | Wine quality ranking(score between 0 and 10) | int

#### Features
Name | Description | Type
:---: | :---: | :---:
fixed acidity  |  Most acids involved with wine or fixed or nonvolatile | float
volatile acidity  |  The amount of acetic acid in wine | float
residual sugar | The amount of sugar remaining after fermentation stops| float
chlorides | The amount of salt in the wine | float
free sulfur dioxide | The free form of SO2 exists in equilibrium between molecular SO2 (as a dissolved gas) and bisulfite ion | float
density | The density of water is close to that of water depending on the percent alcohol and sugar content  | float
pH | Describes how acidic or basic a wine is on a scale from 0 (very acidic) to 14 (very basic) | float
sulphates | A wine additive which can contribute to sulfur dioxide gas (S02) levels | int
alcohol | The percent alcohol content of the wine| float

- This project uses a various classification models to predict drivers in red wine quality rankiings.
- In this README we will :
    * Explain what the project is and goals I attempted to reach. 
    * Explain how to reproduce my work. 
    * Contain notes from project planning.

## Goals

**Deliverables:**
1. README.md file containing overall project information, how to reproduce work, and notes from project planning.
2. Jupyter Notebook Report detailing the pipeline process.
3. Python modules that automate the data acquistion, preparation, and exploration process.
